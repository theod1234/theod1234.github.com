The russian and english sites are contained in the folders "en" and "ru", the names of the pages repeat, but the content is different.
The file "index" in the root directory is the opening page which lets you select the language. It links to two other index files, each in its folder.
The images folder is shared, when you are ready to upload to the server, please remove all placeholder files.

title.css is the css file for the first page.
global styles is the css file for the other pages, so if you want to change font, text color, etc. on your site, open that up.]

If you need to try out some stuff with text color and/or size, you can use the files in the arc folder, they are a backup.

Feel free to rename any page you want, but please update the links to that page/ make sure they work by navigating back and forth.

I intend to Change these files to .php later, but only when you are satisfied with the layout. your browser will not be able to load php unless the files are on the server. Let me know when you're ready.

The files are configured to be able to render russian text, so put it in freely, hopefully you will not get any errors while saving. If you should, let me know.

Good Luck,
